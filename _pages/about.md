I am a Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University.  I am interested in investigating linguistic (mostly phonetic and semantic) representations using computational methods and understanding what the computational methods are doing as well as how they compare to human behavior.  At Cornell I am affiliated with the Phonetics Lab, C.Psyd Research Lab (Computational Psycholinguistics), Cornell NLP (Cornell Natural Language Processing Group), and the Interdisiplanary Semantics Group. 

Research Interests: Computational Linguistics, Semantics, Phonetics, Psycholinguistics

When I am not working on research, I have a VERY high-energy dog named Finn.  He loves hikes, learning tricks, and being the center of attention.  I spend my free time playing with my dog, rock climbing, reading, and traveling.  I am an editor of SALT (Semantics and Linguisitc Theory) 29 and SALT 30.
