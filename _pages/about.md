I am a 4th year Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University.  I am interested in investigating semantic and pragmatic question through computational and experimental methods as well as using linguistic knowledge to inform NLP tasks.  At Cornell I am affiliated with  C.Psyd Research Lab (Computational Psycholinguistics), Cornell NLP (Cornell Natural Language Processing Group), LiMe Lab (Language and meaning), and the Interdisiplanary Semantics Group. 

Research Interests: Causality, Computational Linguistics, Semantics, Pragmatics, Psycholinguistics

When I am not working on research, I have a VERY high-energy dog named Finn.  He loves hikes, learning tricks, and being the center of attention.  I spend my free time playing with my dog, rock climbing, reading, and traveling.  I am an editor of SALT (Semantics and Linguisitc Theory) 29 and SALT 30.
