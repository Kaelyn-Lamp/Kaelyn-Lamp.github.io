I will offically graduate with my Ph.D in Linguistics from Cornell University this summer. I am interested in investigating semantic and pragmatic question through computational and experimental methods as well as using linguistic knowledge to inform NLP tasks. My most recent research analyzes the use of causal language in hate speech. At Cornell, I am affiliated with Cornell Computational Linguistics Lab (CLab), Cornell Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Psycholinguistics Discussions (C.Psyd), Linguistic Meaning Lab (LiMe), and Cornell Semantics Group. I was also an editor of SALT (Semantics and Linguistic Theory) 29 and SALT 30.

Research Interests: Causality, Hate Speech, Computational Linguistics, Semantics, Pragmatics, Psycholinguistics

When I am not working on research, I spend time with my VERY high-energy dog named Finn. He loves hiking, car rides, and being the center of attention. Otherwise you can find me rock climbing, reading, and traveling.
