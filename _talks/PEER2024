Limited work quantitatively analyzes how linguistic phenomena are used to manipulate the perception of causality and blame when expressing 
hate speech. Using annotated hate speech datasets, we conducted a corpus analysis of select causal constructions and strategies of indirect speech to see what syntactic choices 
were made by writers of hate speech when referencing minority (targeted) groups and majority groups. We found that hate speech tends to use causal constructions to minimize the causal responsibility 
of majority groups and indirect speech strategies such as word order and passivization to focus on the minority groupâ€™s involvement in events.
